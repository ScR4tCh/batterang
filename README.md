# batterang

A qt based trayicon to monitor your bluetooth devices battery states.

This app utilizes / includes a modified version of [TheWeirdDev's utility](https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level) using a [pydbus2 fork](https://github.com/ScR4tCh/pybluez2).
PyQT5 is used for the UI.

Installation only manually at the time, by cloning/retrieving libs via pip or such (see requirements.txt).

WIP !
